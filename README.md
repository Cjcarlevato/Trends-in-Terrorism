# Trends in Terrorism Shiny App

## Central Quesetions App Attempts to Answer:
### 1. Has terrorism been increasing or decreasing in the last 50 years?
### 2. How have terrorist tactics evolved (i.e. has there been an increase or decrease in hijackings over the last 50 years?)
### 3. Which U.S. states have experienced the most terrorist attacks?
### 4. Which cities around the world experience a disproportionate number of attacks?
### 5. What groups commit the most attacks for a given time period?


## Motivation 
### Terrorism has become a fact of life in the post 9/11 world. With explosion of the Internet and a 24-hour new, terrorism is in the headlines daily. Does the data on terrorism match the noise in the media? Is the world becoming safer despite the occasional disturbing headline? Is terrorism a rising threat in the world? Answering these types questions of questions motivated me to build my Shiny App. My goal is that it will provide governments with information to efficiently deploy resources to thwart future acts of terrorism. I also hope the app will provide civilians—who often overestimate the risk of terrorism because of the availability bias—with a more accurate risk assessment.

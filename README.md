# Trends in Terrorism Shiny App

## Motivation 
### Terrorism has become a fact of life in the post 9/11 world. With explosion of the Internet and a 24-hour new, terrorism is in the headlines daily. Does the data on terrorism match the noise in the media? Is the world becoming safer despite the occasional disturbing headline? Is terrorism a rising threat in the worldr? Answering these types questions of questions motivated me to build my Shiny App. My goal is that it will provide governments with information to efficiently deploy resources to thwart future acts of terrorism. I also hope the app will provide civilians—who often overestimate the risk of terrorism because of the availability bias—with a more accurate risk assessment.

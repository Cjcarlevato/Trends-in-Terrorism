# [Trends in Terrorism Shiny App]: (https://cjcarlevato.shinyapps.io/Trends_In_Terrorism/) 

## Central Questions App Attempts to Answer:
### 1. Has terrorism been increasing or decreasing in the last 50 years?
### 2. How have terrorist tactics evolved (i.e. has there been an increase or decrease in hijackings over the last 50 years)?
### 3. Which U.S. states have experienced the most terrorist attacks?
### 4. Which cities around the world experience a disproportionate number of attacks?
### 5. What groups commit the most attacks for a given time period?


## Motivation 
### Terrorism has become a fact of life in the post 9/11 world. With explosion of the Internet and a 24-hour new, terrorism is in the headlines daily. Does the data on terrorism match the noise in the media? Is the world becoming safer despite the occasional disturbing headline? Is terrorism a rising threat in the world? Answering these types questions of questions motivated me to build my Shiny App. My goal is that it will provide governments with information to efficiently deploy resources to thwart future acts of terrorism. I also hope the app will provide civilians—who often overestimate the risk of terrorism because of the availability bias—with a more accurate risk assessment. 

## Data Source: The Global Terrorism Database
### "The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017 (with additional annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 cases. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and--when identifiable--the group or individual responsible. Statistical information contained in the Global Terrorism Database is based on reports from a variety of open media sources. Information is not added to the GTD unless and until we have determined the sources are credible. Users should not infer any additional actions or results beyond what is presented in a GTD entry and specifically, users should not infer an individual associated with a particular incident was tried and convicted of terrorism or any other criminal offense. If new documentation about an event becomes available, an entry may be modified, as necessary and appropriate. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD available via this online interface in an effort to increase understanding of terrorist violence so that it can be more readily studied and defeated."
